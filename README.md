ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip 
microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.
One of the greatest features ESP32 provides is that it cannot only 
connect to an existing Wi-Fi network and act as a Web Server, but it 
can also set up a network of its own, allowing other devices to connect 
directly to it and access web pages. This is possible because ESP32 can 
operate in three different modes: Station mode, Soft Access Point mode, 
and both at the same time. This provides the possibility of building 
mesh networks
